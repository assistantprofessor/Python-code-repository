An Even-Odd Palindrome string is defined to be a string whose characters at even indices 
form a Palindrome while the characters at odd indices also form a Palindrome separately.

Explanation: 
String formed by characters at odd indices: bzb, which is a Palindrome. 
String formed by characters at even indices: aza, which is a Palindrome. 
Hence, the given string is an Even-Odd Palindrome.
Input: str=”daccad”
